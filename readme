The experimental platform is built based on Vmware vSphere software. The software environment is the Ubuntu18.04 Server system, the number of virtual cores is 8, and the memory is 16GB. We simulated multiple types of Botnet, application layer, network layer, low-rate, DRDoS attacks, and benign traffic of multiple 5G scenarios in the virtual machine. The Botnet has four categories. The application DDoS has four categories. The DRDoS has six categories. The network DDoS has three categories. The LDDoS has four categories. he specific experimental settings and attack methods are described in reference [1-2].
